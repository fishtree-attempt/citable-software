<p><em>Tori is a PhD student in public policy. She is proficient in
Python and uses it a lot when analyzing data for her research. She is
currently occupied by a project for which she collects data online
mainly via APIs of social media platforms or open data portals. She
thinks that her workflow could help researchers working on the similar
topic/same data sources; so it would be useful to share her data
collection and analysis code with the her research community. She hopes
that code sharing could ease the replication of her study, and also
attract more researchers to get their hands on looking into her research
cases. Tori is familiar with data analysis using Python, but not
necessarily with how to publish her own software as she never did it
before. Though, by taking an introductory computational social science
methods course in her department, she has learned how to effectively
manage her code and data. Currently, she put some of her analysis
notebook files in a GitHub repository. But it is mainly for her own
convenience because she is quite comfortable with the collaborative Git
workflow when working with some of her close colleagues. It is not a
widely visible and engaged community project. Tori also does not have
the intention to make it a community project at the moment.</em></p>
<p>Toriâs background knowledge and skills include: * Data analysis in
Python and share code with colleagues in legible notebooks *
Collaboration with other researchers with Git</p>
<p>Toriâs learning goals include: * Publish her code along with her
research results * Make sure her code is citable and discoverable via
academic databases * Share her code in a way that is compatible to her
current workflow, but also accessible to other researchers</p>
<p>Thus, the knowledge and skills that can be acquired to achieve her
goals include: * Linking her code to her research publication when
releasing it * Publish her code in a way that is also convenient for
potential future updates * Understand how her published code could be
found and accessed by others</p>

<p><em>Tom is currently a postdoc at a university-affiliated research
center focused on ecological and environmental science. He has been
proficient in R and using it for data analysis in his research projects
for a long time. One of his ongoing projects focuses on the population
trends of specific fish species in the long term. His data sources
include observation data collected on site and shared via online data
portals. He also do mathematical and statistical modeling, trying to
estimate the future trends of specific fish popolation size and viualize
the prediction results. Tom wants to release his modeling and
visualization code for inferring the fish population trends in the long
term. He thinks it could help other researchers doing similar things
such as tracking other animal specie population trends. He hopes to make
some software contribution to the larger research community, with the
willingness to maintain the software release for the long term. He would
like to package his code and put it on a R package server. It is the
first time he decides to do so.</em></p>
<p>Tomâs background knowledge and skills include: * Familiar with R and
is able to structure and package his code well</p>
<p>Tomâs learning goals include: * Understand how to make his upcoming R
package citable during release * Let his future users understand how to
cite his package</p>
<p>The knowledge and skills can be acquired to achieve his goals
include: * Make his package citabe in both language-specific and
language-agnostic ways * Educate his users how to cite his package *
Release his package in a way that he can provide regular updates and
support, including the citation information</p>

<p><em>Katy recently just got hired in a chemistry lab group as a
postdoc. She now is taking care of the simulation codes created in the
lab years ago. The lab group has been working on the code in a GitHub
repository. They also have maintained a website where they host the
documentation and provide some visibility for research publications
using the code. The lab has been releasing their code written mostly in
C++ via the website for some time. It was until very recently they
rewrote the simulation method in Python for convience use and better
uptake. The Pythonification work was done on GitHub, and Katy is
continuously improving it now. Naturally they started to release the
code via GitHub. Katy needs to manage the release of two parallel
versions of the code in different languages via both GitHub &amp; the
lab website. Of course the whole lab wants to make their code release
citable and it becomes the responsibility of Katy now. Katy works on
code almost in a daily basis but it is also her first time to handle
software releases and make sure things are citable.</em></p>
<p>Katyâs background knowledge and skills include: * Familiar with the
structure, development, and the use of the code * Familiar with GitHub
features, and how to update the lab website</p>
<p>Katyâs learning goals include: * Understand how to make the code
citable via GitHub and her lab website, including other possibilities *
Understand how to keep the code citable through every upcoming
release</p>

<div class="info">
<p><strong>Prompt</strong>: Add any relevant information about how and
why you chose this target audience here. Information like this can be
helpful for future collaborators/contributors/users to understand the
scope of your lesson.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Thoughts on creating learner profiles</strong>: This is
really about thinking about the use cases of the skills to be taught.
For me, this lesson is not supposed to be domain-specifc. The need to
make software citable arises when researchers intend to share their code
with their research community. It should be the endpoint of their data
analysis workflow; and the workflow is expected to be reproducible and
useful for other researchers as well. Thus it is part of the task of
code sharing and distribution. This is the universal use scenario.<br>
However, researchers write code to analyze data in various disciplines,
using different methods. In other words, the task types for which they
write code are different: Some may be handling empirical data, or
digital trace data; while others may be doing computational modelling
and simulating data. They may be writing code in different programming
languages, thus the way the code is organized, packaged, and distributed
is different.<br>
Researchersâ computing skill levels are varied, too. Some may just
adopted computating skills for doing science; while the others may be
seasoned software developers, however, not necessarily being familiar
with how to make software citable.<br>
What could be their pain points? At this point, presumably (i.e.,
without surveying the target audience), once having the intention to
publish their software, they are willing to make their software citable
but do not know the best choice for their specific scenario. They might
not know how the system of software citation works, so that hinders
their vision to make a better decision to make their code citable,
identifiable, and discoverable online.<br>
Would the software to be published a group project, or an individual
project matter?</p>
<p>The first case is to publish research compendium along with
publications. The second case is a deliberate package release in a
language ecosystem. The third case is self-managed software release, but
also on a platform.</p>
<p>In order to work for different learner profiles, things can be
taught: * How to make software citable via different release/publicizing
channels * How to keep software citable during regular updates/releases,
as part of the maintenance work * How to increase the visibility,
discoverability, and accessibility of the software, to users and systems
of online information retrieval * Ideally, how to make âmaintaining
software citableâ part of the software creatorsâ and maintainersâ
workflow * âMaking software citableâ as part of the user outreach</p>

<p>After following this lesson, learners will be able to:</p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Understand</strong> what blocks the visibility,
discoverability, and accessibility of their software online</li>
<li>
<strong>Identify</strong> their options to make software citable and
discoverable</li>
<li>
<strong>Implement</strong> their software discoverability and
citability choice</li>
<li>
<strong>Maintain</strong> the discoverability and citability of
their software</li>
<li>
<strong>Integrate</strong> the creation and maintenance of their
software citability into their workflow</li>
<li>
<strong>Inform</strong> their users when and how to cite their
software</li>
<li>
<strong>Evaluate</strong> their choice and practice of maintaining
software citability {: .objectives }</li>

<h3 id="notes-1">Notes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#notes-1"></a></h3>
<p>Breakdown learning objectives from learnerâs perspective: - Identify
the nature of their code - The need for making software citable always
comes with the publication, release, or distribution of the code. So
identify how to make their code available and public based on the nature
of their code - Identify the citation options based on the mode of
distribution</p>
<p>Break down the lesson into episodes: Starting point: When one is
seeking to make their code visible and available online, they should
start to consider the citability of their software. The first step is to
understand what kind of the code one is working with. Here I consider
two common scenarios: research compendium/workflow for publication
purpose; a specialized piece of software. The second step is to identify
the distribution channel of oneâs code. Here I (again) consider two
common scenarios: share code via GitHub; share code via
language-specific package manager; share code via digital repositories.
The third step is to understand citation options based on the
distribution channel, including human-readable and machine-readable
options. Sometimes consider language-specific cases. Also consider how
to evaluate the operations &amp; make updates. That seems to suggest 3-4
episodes for now.</p>
<p>Also consider some conceptual stuff first: - Why visibility of
software is important: consider oneâs intention to
share/publish/distribute (or even hand-off) software. (that intersects
with what kind of code they are trying to share, and how, as well.) -
Visibility works for direct reach-out to end-users, and mediated by
search engine, databases, etc. - Have a human-readable citation
suggestion/request at every point of connection to end-users - Have a
machine-readable citaion/software metadata file also at the reach of
end-users (so they can directly use in their âexecutable papersâ or when
they are repurposing the code), and exposed to online databases that
register software -</p>

    2022-11-07: we have gotten a notification that we have an overage for our
    tracking and I'm pretty sure this has to do with Workbench usage.
    Considering that I am not _currently_ using this tracking because I do not
    yet know how to access the data, I am turning this off for now.

    var _paq = window._paq = window._paq || [];
    /* tracker methods like "setCustomDimension" should be called before "trackPageView" */

    _paq.push(["setDoNotTrack", true]);
    _paq.push(["disableCookies"]);
    _paq.push(['trackPageView']);
    _paq.push(['enableLinkTracking']);
    (function() {
          var u="https://carpentries.matomo.cloud/";
